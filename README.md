# Fuel-Cost-Predictor
Hello, I have made a Machine Learning Project using Linear Regression,
It is used to predict the fuel cost for a vehicle.


The input format is:
YEAR: From 2000-2022
MAKE: Company Name
MODEL: Model name
VEHICLE CLASS: Based on the Seats on the Vehicle
ENGINE SIZE: Size of Engine
CYLINDERS: Number of Cylinders needed
FUEL: 1(X)
      2(Y)
      3(Z)


The Output is:
FUEL CONSUMPTION

Download the CSV file -> take the location of the file -> and, 
Add that location in the place of 'file' variable present in the fuel-cost-ml.ipynb file.
